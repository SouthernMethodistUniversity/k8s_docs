## Welcome

The Research Kubernetes Cluster at SMU is available for faculty research and classroom use cases via a consultation with [Mateo Langston Smith](mailto:mlangstonsmith@smu.edu). 

## Use Cases

The SMU Research Kubernetes Cluster is designed primarily for web-based research and teaching services rather than traditional HPC workloads. It is well suited for hosting research web applications and dashboards, deploying API-backed services, supporting classroom applications, and running small-scale demonstrations. The cluster excels at long-lived services and workloads with variable demand, where reliability and scalability are more important than raw compute performance.
